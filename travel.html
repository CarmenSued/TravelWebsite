                 <p>Tarifa is simply a beautiful town where to go whatever time of the year, but obviously,
                 spring and summertime is when we can really enjoy this town thanks to the amazing weather of Andalucia, therefore, 
                 here are my top 5 tips  to make the most of your visit:</p>
		
			    <h3>  Accommodation  </h3>
			    <p>

				There are multiple options you can enjoy, from villages, amazing hotels, rural houses and hostel, but if you really want to live the summer experience in Tarifa, try to <span class="bold">rent or come with a van </span>,
                there are campings with a little cost and all facilities available. 
				</p>
			
	            <h3>  Food </h3>
			    <p> 
				<img src="media/gazpachoglass.jpg"  class="travelimg" alt="gazpacho"><!-- picture fromhttps://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2013/05/17/nine-summer-soup-recipes/--><br>
				Food in the province of Cadiz is a must, specially seafood, but one of the most popular foods is <span class="bold">gazpacho or salmorejo</span>,
                a refreshing cold tomato soup that is consumed daily in the summertime, also there is a lot of bohemian teas and coffees places where you can taste some of the most popular  Andalusian or Moroccan pastries.
				</p>
				
			
			   <h3> Horse Riding </h3>
			   <p>

			   Already you know this is a place for kitesurfers, but there is another experience accessible as <span class="bold"> riding a horse by the beach</span>,
               experience highly recommended for those who are preferring being close to the earth and have a great evening watching the sunset. 
			   </p>
			   
			   <h3>Day and Nightlife</h3>
			   <p>

			   <!--https://www.diadios.com/servicios/fiestas-tarifa/chiringuitos-->
				Day and night are special in Tarifa, enjoy the vibes of being having cocktails and food in whatever <span class="bold"> chiringuito </span> during the day, then after a beach day, the
                nightlife in Tarifa is absolutely vibrant, there is a lot of open pubs and clubs with garden for those nights where the temperature gets really high in summer.
				<span class="bold"> Mojitos and dance </span> is a good combination for a great night out during the holidays in this little town.
				</p>
			  
			    <h3> Don't forget a jacket </h3>
			    <p> 
				Summer can be really hot in July and August, but this is <span class="bold">the city of the wind </span> and usually by the evening always is a fresh air or strongs winds, that is why even if you are coming in summertime,
				is a good idea to get a thin cardigan, jacket or scarf with you to prevent surprises .

			    <h2> Tarifa</h2>
				<p>
				<span class="bold">Tarifa</span> is a small town in the province of Cadiz, Spain. 
				This little town that will trap you due to its bohemian enviroment with a lot of Morocco touches in their arquitecture,
				what makes Tarifa a very magical place.
				With whites and long beaches where you can  walk enjoying the best sunsets of the south of Spain.
				The old part of the town offers many cosy shops and cafes with a chill out atmosphere. 
			    Tarifa is one of the most popular spots for kite surfing in all Europe thanks to the wind that receives from Levante (east) and Poniente (west). 
				The nightlife is very vibrant having a lot of pubs for drinks, tapas and dance, 
				dont forget take a jacket as late in the evening the weather usually is chilled.

				 Absolutely love the town and can't wait to return, full of life and great tapas, we have loved to get lost trhough the town and their beaches. 
				 Bolonia beach was one of our favourites, where we enjoyed the best sunsents of south Spain.
